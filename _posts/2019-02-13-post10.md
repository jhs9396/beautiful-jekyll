## Prepare
- Before the post : <https://jhs9396.github.io/2019-02-13-post9/>
- This post is an example of using the levenshtein distance to create a relationship between data that is determined to be similar. I can not say that doing this is the right answer.

## Scenario
- Suppose you have a sample of an cypher security report.
- Sample data is four reports. 
- Each report includes 
    - intrusion set
    - ip
    - domain
    - hash
    - file name
    - purpose_info

1) Test data import
- Here same script : <https://gist.github.com/jhs9396/115a0a047a2df098550cc4191d9bd69f>
