## Prepare
- Current AgensGraph version is release lastest 2.1 version.
- I will compare 2.0 and 2.1 version
- installation (AgensGraph v.2.0 and AgensGraph v.2.1)

## AgensGraph Metagarph search query

below view cypher query, this graph pattern is two 'Vertex' inside one 'Edge' pattern.
This pattern is called by cypher query language.
The cypher query below works fine with version 2.0.

#### query (2.0 under version)
````
match (a)-[r]->(b)
with graphid_labid(start(r)) as s_oid, graphid_labid(id(r)) as e_oid, graphid_labid("end"(r)) as t_oid
return e_oid, s_oid, t_oid, count(*) as cnt;

 e_oid | s_oid | t_oid |   cnt
-------+-------+-------+---------
     3 |    10 |    10 |      90
     3 |    13 |    13 |    5665
     3 |    14 |    14 |    2847
     3 |    15 |    15 |    5222
    27 |    13 |     7 |   45917
    27 |    13 |    21 |   65352

## SOLUTION
1) you meta_table(called by ag_graphmeta) available from AgensGraph 2.0 release
````
SELECT * 
FROM   pg_catalog.ag_graphmeta
WHERE  graph = (SELECT oid FROM pg_catalog.ag_graph WHERE graphname = 'movie');

 graph | edge | start | end | edgecount
-------+------+-------+-----+----------
 16816 |    5 |     1 |   3 |         6
 16816 |    7 |     4 |   3 |        15
 16816 |    8 |     4 |   3 |        10
 16816 |    5 |     4 |   3 |       165
 16816 |    6 |     4 |   3 |        44
 16816 |   10 |     4 |   3 |         9
 16816 |    9 |     4 |   4 |         3
(7 rows)
````
 - postgresql oid is Object Identifier. It is hidden.
 - 'movie' is graph_path name. if you graph_path don't know, console login and enter '\dG'
 
2) Hybrid query search executing. (include group by)
````
SELECT e_oid, s_oid, t_oid, count(*) AS cnt
FROM (match (a)-[r]->(b)
with graphid_labid(start(r)) as s_oid, graphid_labid(id(r)) as e_oid, graphid_labid("end"(r)) as t_oid
return e_oid, s_oid, t_oid) t1 
GROUP BY e_oid, s_oid, t_oid;

 e_oid | s_oid | t_oid | cnt
-------+-------+-------+-----
     5 |     4 |     3 | 165
     7 |     4 |     3 |  15
     5 |     1 |     3 |   6
     6 |     4 |     3 |  44
     9 |     4 |     4 |   3
     8 |     4 |     3 |  10
    10 |     4 |     3 |   9
(7 rows)
