---

## Prepare
- Current AgensGraph version is released lastest 2.1 version.
- Installation (AgensGraph v.2.0)
- 2.1 version requires a bug fix.

## Comment
- The string similarity example will proceed with the levenshtein distance first. 
- I will summarize more string similarity verification schemes in the future if possible.
- This post related to the use case rather than the concept of levenshtein distance. I will not mention here because the concept comes from search.

## Extension 
- There is an extension command in postgresql. Levenshtein distance function is present in the 'fuzzystrmatch' extension.
- Before fuzzystrmatch extension command, When you compile AgensGraph, you must specify the following keywords.
