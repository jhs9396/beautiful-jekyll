title: Example of string similarity using AgensGraph
image: /img/hello_world.jpeg
---

## Prepare
- Current AgensGraph version is released lastest 2.1 version.
- Installation (AgensGraph v.2.0)
- 2.1 version requires a bug fix.

## Comment
- The string similarity example will proceed with the levenshtein distance first. 
- I will summarize more string similarity verification schemes in the future if possible.
- This post related to the use case rather than the concept of levenshtein distance. I will not mention here because the concept comes from search.
- The smaller the levenshtein distance cost, the more comparable the value.

## Extension 
- There is an extension command in postgresql. Levenshtein distance function is present in the 'fuzzystrmatch' extension.
- Before fuzzystrmatch extension command, When you compile AgensGraph, you must specify the following keywords.

````
$ make && make install-world
````
- There is a branch in the Makefile (install-world). 

If AgensGraph compile is complete, you can execute 'create extension' in cli(command line interface).

````
[agens@5628b77c5e38 agensgraph-2.0.0]$ agens
agens (AgensGraph 2.0.0, based on PostgreSQL 10.4)
Type "help" for help.

agens=#
agens=#
agens=# CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;
CREATE EXTENSION
agens=#
````
- You can check the function using the '\df' command.
````
\df+ levenshtein
````

## levenshtein function example
- There are two vertice. 
- Each vertice has include property called by name.
- I will execute Cypher query
````
-- first graph path create
CREATE GRAPH test;
-- set graph_path (similar to RDB(mysql, mssql) USE DATABASE)
SET GRAPH_PATH TO test;
CREATE (:person {name:'hsjeon'});
CREATE (:person {name:'jhs'});
````
