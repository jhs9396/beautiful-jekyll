title: MongoFDW to AgensGraph data for visualization 1 to 2
image: /img/hello_world.jpeg
---
## 1. Purpose
- AgensGraph is multi-database(RDB+GDB). It is database in NoSQL area . I usually had used the Relational-Database(Oracle, MySQL) for SQL.
- To exercise NoSQL.
- Foreign Data Wrapper(FDW) is extensional skill in PostgreSQL.
- AgensGraph based on PostgreSQL.
- Studying with React, Python. 
- For me. Using the MongoFDW(enterprise-DB/MongoFDW) is too hard. So editing
- chapter 1 page is installation guide. AgensGraph, MongoDB, MongoFDW
- chapter 2 page is foreign table SELECT, and data visualization by cytoscape.js.

## 1-1. Next Posting
- MongoFDW to AgensGraph data for visualization 2 to 2
- OracleFDW to AgensGraph data for visualization

## 2. Install
````
environment
- Docker image CentOS 7 â†‘
    * docker images empty library and very cleanning environment.
````
----
### 2-1. BASIC SETTING!
 - sudoers user creating
````

passwd test
usermod -aG wheel test (sudoers auth)
````
 - Using to YUM repository, and packaging install
````
yum install sudo wget git make unzip gcc glibc glib-common readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel flex bison python-devel -y
````
 - test user connection
````
su - test
````

### 2-2. AgensGraph installation
- add
````
git clone https://github.com/bitnine-oss/agensgraph.git
````
- c file compile and make 
````
./configure --prefix=$HOME/agraph (optional ->  --with-python(for plpythonu)...  --with-ssl)
-> ./configure --prefix=$HOME/agraph --with-python
...
...
make && make install-world (-world keyword is fuzzystrmatch extension, and etc...)
````
- AgensGraph(ps A.G) environment variables setting
````
vi ~/.bashrc
#### AgensGraph setting
export AGHOME=$HOME/agraph
export PATH=$AGHOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AGHOME/lib:$LD_LIBLIRARY_PATH
export AGDATA=$HOME/db_cluster

#### docker locale setting
export LANG=en_US.utf8

#### PostgreSQL variables. AgensGraph based on PostgreSQL maybe changing?
export PGPORT=5555
export PGUSER=test
````
- bashrc injection
````
source ~/.bashrc
or
. .bashrc
````
- initialize DB cluster
* DB locale is dependent on OS locale.
````
initdb
````
- A.G start
````
ag_ctl start
````
- A.G DB creating
* initialized user name(PostgreSQL role)
````
createdb 
````
- DB console connect(equals psql)
````
agens
````
if under screenshot is displayed, you success AgensGraph installation.
