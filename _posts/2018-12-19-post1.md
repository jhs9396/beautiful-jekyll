image: /img/hello_world.jpeg

## 1. Purpose
- AgensGraph is multi-database(RDB+GDB). It is database in NoSQL area . I usually had used the Relational-Database(Oracle, MySQL) for SQL.
- To exercise NoSQL.
- Foreign Data Wrapper(FDW) is extensional skill in PostgreSQL.
- AgensGraph based on PostgreSQL.
- Studying with React, Python. 
- For me. Using the MongoFDW(enterprise-DB/MongoFDW) is too hard. So editing
- chapter 1 page is installation guide. AgensGraph, MongoDB, MongoFDW
- chapter 2 page is foreign table SELECT, and data visualization by cytoscape.js.
