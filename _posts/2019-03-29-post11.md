## Environment
- AgensGraph v2.0 release
- CentOS 7 (python 2.7)
- enabled 'pip' executor

## Setting
#### step 1. AgensGraph install (configure --with-python)
- If you downloaded AgensGraph 2.0 source, you must be compiled C language files. Because we will use PL/Python in AgensGraph.
- When you compiled files, you need to configure setting 

````
user@pwd/blah/blah$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/agraph --with-python
...
user@pwd/blah/blah$ make && make install-world
````
- Next phase are init db, ag_ctl start, create db and etc.. Reference guide : <https://github.com/bitnine-oss/agensgraph>
- I will use the following:
````
CREATE GRAPH community_detection;
SET GRAPH_PATH TO community_detection;
````
#### step 2. AgensGraph install (configure --with-python)
