---

## Environment
- AgensGraph v2.0 release
- CentOS 7 (python 2.7)
- enabled 'pip' executor

## Setting
#### step 1. AgensGraph install (configure --with-python)
- If you downloaded AgensGraph 2.0 source, you must be compiled C language files. Because we will use PL/Python in AgensGraph.
- When you compiled files, you need to configure setting 

````
user@pwd/blah/blah$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/agraph --with-python
...
user@pwd/blah/blah$ make && make install-world
````
- Next phase are init db, ag_ctl start, create db and etc.. Reference guide : <https://github.com/bitnine-oss/agensgraph>
- I will use the following:
````
agens (AgensGraph 2.0.0, based on PostgreSQL 10.4)
Type "help" for help.

agens=#
agens=# CREATE GRAPH community_detection;
CREATE GRAPH
agens=# SET GRAPH_PATH TO community_detection;
SET
agens=#
````
#### step 2. AgensGraph plpython language creating
- If you follow along well, the next step is easy.
- In CLI, the following:

````
CREATE LANGUAGE plpythonu;
````

#### step 3. python networkx library download
- By using 'pip' executor, you can use the download networkx library.
- And pip install networkx, pip install python-louvain, pip install numpy
- (pip install pycopg2) is the most popular PostgreSQL adapter. (AgensGraph is based on PostgreSQL.)
- (account with administrator rights)
````
user@pwd/blah/blah$ sudo pip install networkx
user@pwd/blah/blah$ sudo pip install python-louvain
user@pwd/blah/blah$ sudo pip install numpy
user@pwd/blah/blah$ sudo pip install psycopg2
````

#### step 4. community detection example
- Next. In AgensGraph CLI mode, you can write the script used python.
- It is similar to Oracle's PL/SQL. AgensGraph uses python as the procedure language. Of course, SQL also exists.
- Dataset is 6 nodes and 3 edges. following:
````
SET GRAPH_PATH TO community_detection;

CREATE (a:person {name:'hsjeon'})-[r:knows]->(b:person {name:'jhs'});
CREATE (a:person {name:'foo'})-[r:knows]->(b:person {name:'bar'});
CREATE (a:person {name:'test'})-[r:knows]->(b:person {name:'test1'});
````
- I will use to the networkx that is called by louvain method algorithm. 
- concept reference wiki link <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity>
- networkx api : <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/tutorial/tutorial.html>
- easy script is following. I will write a simple script using the networkx library.
````
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION louvain_method()
RETURNS void as $$
import networkx as nx
import psycopg2 as ag
import community

# query execute function
def doQuery(qry):
   try:
      conn = ag.connect("host=127.0.0.1 port=5555 dbname=agens user=agens password=agens")
      cur = conn.cursor()
      cur.execute("SET GRAPH_PATH TO community_detection")

      cur.execute(qry)
      records = cur.fetchall()

      # networkx graph add edge. because graph data already search.
      G.add_edges_from([tuple(r) for r in records])
   except Exception, e:
      plpy.error(e)
   finally:
      conn.commit()
      cur.close()
      conn.close()

# Creating networkx empty graph 
G = nx.Graph()

# AgensGraph graph data search query (all data)
query = "MATCH (a)-[r]->(b) RETURN id(a) AS startNode, id(b) AS endNode"

# query execute
doQuery(query)

# louvain method algorithm execute
partition = community.best_partition(G)

# modularity print
plpy.info("modularity >> "+str(community.modularity(partition,G)))

# partition result search
cluster = 0
for com in set(partition.values()):
    cluster = cluster + 1
    list_nodes = [nodes for nodes in partition.keys() if partition[nodes] == com]
    
    # result print
    plpy.info(cluster,list_nodes)

$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;
````
- It is a simple script that runs the networkx louvain method algorithm after viewing the entire graph in AgensGraph.
- This function execute is following:
````
agens=# SELECT louvain_method();
INFO:  modularity >> 0.666666666667
INFO:  (1, ['6.6', '6.5'])
INFO:  (2, ['6.4', '6.3'])
INFO:  (3, ['6.2', '6.1'])
 louvain_method
----------------

(1 row)
````
- In the above test data, we created six nodes with three relationships. You can see that the connected ones are community detection.
- Then, in the next test, (hsjeon and foo), (jhs and bar) know each other and create a relationship.
````
MATCH (a:person),(b:person)
WHERE a.name = 'hsjeon'
AND   b.name = 'foo'
CREATE (a)-[r:knows]->(b);

MATCH (a:person),(b:person)
WHERE a.name = 'jhs'
AND   b.name = 'bar'
CREATE (a)-[r:knows]->(b);
````
- And check that community detection is working normally to find two communities.
````
agens=# SELECT louvain_method();
INFO:  modularity >> 0.32
INFO:  (1, ['6.6', '6.5'])
INFO:  (2, ['6.4', '6.3', '6.2', '6.1'])

````
- Clustering is done using algorithms, clusters may not be found as you might think.
- In order to increase the modularity, it is necessary to configure the graph modeling according to the priority so that the desired cluster can be obtained.
